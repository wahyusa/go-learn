## Installation

I am using main branch for this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wahyusa/go-learn.git
```

## Usage (local)

This is only works on locals and not deployed to any hosting or cloud provider.

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Accessible endpoint

**[HTTP POST]**

http://localhost:8080/users/register

**[HTTP POST]**

http://localhost:8080/users/register

That's it!

I am pretty confidence that all endpoint will works fine and following the requirements on the **[API SPECS](https://github.com/wahyusa/go-learn/blob/main/documentation/API_specs.yaml)**, at least for that 2 endpoint.
